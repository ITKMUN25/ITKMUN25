                <h4>Duru Dokur</h4>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;" >Dear Participants, <br>
                  <br>
                  It is an immense honor to welcome you all to the 3rd Annual Session of the Izmir Private Turkish College Model United Nations. Words cannot fully express how thrilled I am to serve as the Director-General of this prestigious conference hosted by my very own school. <br>
                  <br>
                  My name is Duru Dokur, and I am an 11th grader at Izmir Private Turkish College Science High School. Having been a part of the MUN community for the past three years, I am both excited and proud to lead this incredible event. From the moment I participated in my first conference, it has been a dream of mine to organize my own. The fact that this conference is now a reality and that it is welcoming you all is truly a dream come true for me. <br>
                  <br>
                  Indeed, this achievement would not have been possible without the support of my amazing organization and academic team. Every member of this large and dedicated family has put in countless hours of effort to ensure that this conference is a unique experience for all of you. <br>
                  <br>
                  The time has finally come, and we are confident that this conference will offer you an experience you will never forget. We are proud to welcome you to ITKMUN’25. We can’t wait to meet you! <br>
                  <br>
                  Sincerely

                <h3>Letter from the Secratary General</h3>
                <h4>Volkan Altındağ</h4>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;" > 
                  Distinguished delegates, <br>
                  <br>
                  It is with immense pleasure that I welcome you to ITKMUN’25 as your secretary general. On behalf of the executive team, this conference took lots of time and hard work; and it is finally the time. <br>
                  <br>
                  I am Volkan Altındağ, a senior student from Izmir Private Turkish College Anatolian High School. I have spent a significant amount of time while studying for and attending MUNs during high school, and it’s now my turn to be one of the hosts of my school's MUN. I’ve been dreaming of this since middle school and I feel immense pride in myself and my team to be conducting this conference. <br>
                  <br>
                  During this conference you will be participating in debates and working together with our hand picked and highly esteemed academy team and delegates. We have decided not to go for a theme for our conference as we didn’t want to limit our agenda items and topics to a certain issue, since we truly believe that there are too many problems that shouldn’t be ignored because we were only using agenda items to suit our topic. Please rest assured that you will have a great time during this year’s ITKMUN, and make use of this opportunity to create lasting memories. We will be waiting for you. <br>
                  <br>
                  Sincerely  
                
                </p>
